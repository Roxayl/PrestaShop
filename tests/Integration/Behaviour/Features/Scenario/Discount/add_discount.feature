Feature: Add discount
  PrestaShop allows BO users to create discounts
  As a BO user
  I must be able to create discounts

  Background:
    Given shop "shop1" with name "test_shop" exists
    Given there is a currency named "usd" with iso code "USD" and exchange rate of 0.92
    Given there is a currency named "chf" with iso code "CHF" and exchange rate of 1.25
    Given currency "usd" is the default one
    And language with iso code "en" is the default one


  Scenario: Create a simple discount with free shipping
    When I create a free shipping discount "discount_1" with following properties:
      | name[en-US]                      | Promotion              |
      | free_shipping                    | true                   |
    And discount "discount_1" should have the following properties:
      | name[en-US]                      | Promotion              |
      | free_shipping                    | true                   |
  Scenario: Create a complete discount with free shipping
